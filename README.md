This texture pack aims to create a Commodore 64 8-bit style environment for 
Minetest.  All images herein are hand-drawn, based on the overall style 
used in my(VannessaE) photorealistic packs (but of course limited to what a C64 
could theoretically display).

put the texture pack in the /textures folder and enable the texture pack from 
the content tab
